**What is Cloud Computing?** <br>
The Cloud (or Cloud Computing) refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and managing physical hardware, companies and individuals can access on-demand computing resources from cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

**Types of Cloud Computing :** <br>
*1.Public Cloud* – Services provided over the internet (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). <br>
*2.Private Cloud* – Dedicated cloud infrastructure for a single organization. <br>
*3.Hybrid Cloud* – A mix of public and private cloud services. <br>

**Cloud Computing Service Models :** <br>
*IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)* - Provides virtual servers, storage, and networking <br>
                                       ex. AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine <br>
                                       
*PaaS (Platform as a Service)* -	Provides a managed environment for app development	<br>
                                  ex. AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine  <br>

*SaaS (Software as a Service)* - Delivers software applications over the internet	<br>
                                ex. Gmail, Dropbox, Office 365 <br>

*Region:* In AWS (Amazon Web Services), a Region is a geographical area where AWS has multiple data centers (called Availability Zones) that host cloud resources and services. <br>
ex. ap-south-1, us-east-1, us-east-2 <br>

*Availability Zone (AZ):* An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate data center within an AWS Region. Each region has at least two AZs, and they are designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs. <br>
