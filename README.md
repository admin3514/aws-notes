**What is Cloud Computing?** 
The Cloud (or Cloud Computing) refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and managing physical hardware, companies and individuals can access on-demand computing resources from cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

**Types of Cloud Computing**
*1.Public Cloud* – Services provided over the internet (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
*2.Private Cloud* – Dedicated cloud infrastructure for a single organization.
*3.Hybrid Cloud* – A mix of public and private cloud services.

**Cloud Computing Service Models**

*Region:* In AWS (Amazon Web Services), a Region is a geographical area where AWS has multiple data centers (called Availability Zones) that host cloud resources and services.
ex. ap-south-1, us-east-1, us-east-2

*Availability Zone (AZ):* An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate data center within an AWS Region. Each region has at least two AZs, and they are designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs.
